A simple MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project built to practice full-stack development fundamentals. This app allows users to register, login, and perform CRUD operations on student records.

🔰 My first MERN project — built to learn backend development with Node.js and MongoDB.

🛠 Features
🔐 User Authentication (Register/Login)

📝 CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete students)

🔄 State Management with React Hooks

🌐 RESTful API integration using Axios

💾 MongoDB Database for storing user and student data

📦 Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Axios, Tailwind CSS (optional)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)

Authentication: JWT & bcrypt
